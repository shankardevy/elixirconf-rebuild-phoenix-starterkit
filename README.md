# Starter Kit for Rebuild Phoenix and Demystic Magic in POE

This repo is for people who are attending my training [Rebuild Phoenix and Demystic Magic in POE](http://www.elixirconf.eu/events/elixirconfeu2019/training#rebuild-phoenix-and-demystify-the-magic-in-poe-18) at ElixirConfEU.

# Steps to do
1. Clone this repo and run `mix deps.get` from within all top level folders. If you have this repo cloned, you will not be required to download anything during the training. All things that we need to rebuild a mini-version of Phoenix is contained in this repo.
2. Install latest Elixir. Use Elixir 1.7 or latest 1.8. I haven't tested the code in older versions of Elixir though I believe any version above 1.5 should work.
